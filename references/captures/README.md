# Captures

Captured artifacts (screenshots, exports, archives) kept out of published output.

Use this folder for heavy or non-runtime files that should never ship in `public/`.

## Notes

- Keep filenames descriptive and timestamped when possible.
- Add short context notes for important captures (what page/state they represent).
- Use `references/captures/legacy-public-image/` for archived migrated runtime imagery.
