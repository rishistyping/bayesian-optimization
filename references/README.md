# References

Non-published research artifacts and source materials.

## Folder map

- `references/distill/`: Distill-specific guidance and reference notes.
- `references/specs/`: accepted plans/spec documents.
- `references/prototypes/`: non-runtime prototype code experiments.
- `references/inspirations/`: visual and interaction inspirations.
- `references/captures/`: screenshots/exports/archives and other heavy artifacts.

## Rules

- Nothing in this folder is part of deployed runtime.
- Do not import files from here into `public/` unless explicitly promoted through a runtime decision.
- Keep citation/source context near captured materials when possible.
