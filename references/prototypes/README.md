# Prototypes

Non-runtime prototype code and experiments.

Prototype files here are intentionally excluded from production runtime unless explicitly promoted.

## Current artifacts

- `references/prototypes/rain_bayes_panel_d3.js`
  - legacy prototype for rain/bayes panel experimentation.

If promoting a prototype to runtime, rewrite/refactor it into `public/js/**` rather than copying directly.
