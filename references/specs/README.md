# Specs

Planning specs and accepted implementation plans.

Keep product/engineering plans here, not in `public/`.

## Recommended format

Each spec should include:

- summary and scope,
- interface/API impact,
- file-by-file change map,
- acceptance criteria and test scenarios,
- assumptions and defaults.

When a plan is implemented, link the resulting commit(s) in the spec for traceability.
