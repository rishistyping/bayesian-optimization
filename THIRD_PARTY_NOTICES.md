# Third-Party Notices

This project includes an interaction style inspired by:

- rpsychologist Bayes visualization by Kristoffer Magnusson
  - https://rpsychologist.com/d3/bayes/
- Seeing Theory (Brown University) compound/conditional probability visualization
  - https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/compound-probability/index.html
- Setosa conditional probability visualization by Victor Powell
  - http://setosa.io/conditional/

This repo implements its own Rain/Bayes-specific model, UI structure, and rendering pipeline.

D3.js is used from a local vendored file for offline runtime.
